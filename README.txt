Choose Your Own Adventure Game
An interactive text-based adventure game where players create their own character and journey through a personalized story based on their MBTI personality type. Built using Python and Tkinter, with plans to expand to space, pirate, and fantasy story settings.

Current Status
This game is a work in progress. Currently, only the Introduction section of the Space Adventure is available. Future plans include adding exploration, pirate, and fantasy settings, each with different characters, classes, and personality types for the player to choose from.

Features
Character Creation based on MBTI personality type.
Story-based interactions where player choices affect the narrative.
Space Adventure theme (more themes coming soon!).
